# portfolio-site

Hi! My name is Evan Humphrey and this is the repo for my porfolio site!

I developed this personal site mostly for resume purposes, so I could show off all the projects that I have been working on throughout my time in college. After spending a bit of time on the framework for the website, this turned more into a passion project where I was able to express myself through the development of this website.

I worked really hard to establish a theme (or vibe, depending on how you'd like to think about it.) that spoke to how I think a personalized website should look. I really feel that I have poured a piece of myself and my interests into this website.

This website was developed using only pure HTML and CSS (maybe I'll add some JS in later if I can think of anything cool to do with it.)

But for now this website is still under development as there are still a few things I want to iron out with the themeing and general dynamic frame of the website.

I know that readme's aren't really something that most people read...so thanks for listening to me ramble about this, I just thought I'd give you some background of how this has evolved from a purely portfolio project into something that I find myself thinking about during downtimes in my schedule.

**Thanks for visiting!**
