        <div class = "rant-body">
            <p>why is this website not loading any of the supporting attributes that most modern websites have?<br>
            elements and features like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>fancy schmancy animations</li>
              <li>work in progess</li>
              <li>or literally anything besides plain text and images</li>
            </ul>

            <p>the truth is that i don't think that this website needs any of that. 
            i want to keep it simple to maintain and update for future me to come back to.<br>
            plus i dont do a lot of web development these days <strong>(nor do i enjoy it)</strong>, 
            so this is of a personal project to show off other accomplishments more than anything else.</p>
