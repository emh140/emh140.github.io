          hi!<br><br> im evan humphrey.<br>
          i'm an undergraduate computer science,<br>
          computer engineering, and electrical engineering student
        </h2>
      <p>
        i'm based in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Morgantown,+WV">morgantown, wv</a> where i attend<br>
        west virginia university as a senior.

    <!-- maybe add the menu for navigation at the bottom of the screen rather than the top,
     seems kinda cliche to have it at the top -->
     <div class = "rant-head">
        <h1>i'm sure you're probably wondering...</h1>
        <div class = "rant-body">
            <p>why is this website not loading any of the supporting attributes that most modern websites have?<br>
            elements and features like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>fancy animations</li>
              <li>page transitions</li>
              <li>or literally anything besides plain text and images</li>
            </ul>

            <p>the truth is that i don't think that this website needs any of that. 
            i want to keep it simple to maintain and update for future me to come back to. otherwise this becomes more of a "time-consumer" than a porfolio for me.<br><br>
            plus i dont do a lot of web development these days, 
            so this is a personal project to show off other accomplishments more than anything else. think of it more as an in-depth portfolio.</p>

      <!--i want this to have pictures with text in the foreground saying what it is-->
